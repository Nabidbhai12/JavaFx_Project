# `JavaFx_Project`
This is my term project for Level-1/Term-II in the CSE 108: Object Oriented Programming Language Sessional course. It is a JavaFX application that utilizes Java Networking to connect a club to a local server. The application allows users to register a club account and access various features. Within a club, users can view, search, and filter a list of club players as needed.

The main challenge of this project was implementing server-based networking, enabling clubs to connect with each other for player transfers. The transfer market automatically refreshes based on user input, and necessary transfers can be made.

The player database used in the program is created by reading a given text file provided as part of the academic project. Since the number of players is small (currently 25), most of the searching algorithms used in the application are linear for simplicity.
